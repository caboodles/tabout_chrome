# Tabout for Codetree

Tabout is an extension that allows you to tab out of specific characters with ease, originally created as a Visual Studio Code extension by Albert Romkes.
This chrome extension brings the same functionality to Codetree's online editor.  
Simply click the extension icon to toggle the feature on or off.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension files.

## Files

- `manifest.json`: Configuration file for the Chrome extension.
- `background.js`: Background script that handles the extension's state and badge updates.
- `content.js`: Content script that provides the tabbing out functionality.
- `icons/`: Directory containing the extension icons.

## Note
This extension is not yet complete and requires further upgrades to be fully compatible with all layouts and scrolling behavior within Codetree's editor.
